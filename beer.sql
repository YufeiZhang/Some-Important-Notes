-- Q2

select name as "Beer", manf as "Brewer" from beers;

-- Q3

select distinct Beers.manf as brewer

-- Q4

select b1.name, b2.name

-- Q5

-- using a non-correlated subquery
-- strategy:
-- * nested query finds brewers who make only one beer
-- * outer query selects beers made by those brewers

select name
from   Beers
where  manf in (select manf
			    from   beers
			    group by manf
			    having count(name) = 1)


-- or, using a correlated subquery
-- strategy:
-- * for each Beer b
-- * check for other beers made by b's brewer
-- * if none, the choose Beer b as a result

select b.name
from   Beers b
where  not exists (select *
                   from   Beers b1
                   where  b1.manf = b.manf and b1.name <> b.name);
